            <img src="images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera" width="400"  onclick="openLightbox(this)">
            <p>
                Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake
                for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their
                inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in
                the wild they form packs of five to ten.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny
                hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is
                eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the
                cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.
            </p>

                width="400"  onclick="openLightbox(this)">
            <p>
                Riley is a 2yr old goldendoodle. He is very active and loves attention. Riley can be pretty mischievous;
                as such, his favorite activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on a cool
                floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk in his local park or hang out with his
                best friend Cosmo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and pampered. He’s currently in his
                “terrible twos,” and must get everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a perfect,
                funny, and loyal dog.

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.png" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei" width="400"  onclick="openLightbox(this)">
            <p>
                Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
            </p>

            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.png" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400"  onclick="openLightbox(this)">
            <p>
                Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and
                tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven
                foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like
                a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own
                name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

            <p>MiaoMiao is the best cat in the world, extremely social with other, and vigilant against strangers.
                Oftentimes you can find her running around the house looking for things to eat. If she consumed anything
                other than cat food, she immediately throws up. </p>
            <p>She is chill and chirpy. Loves to play with anything other than professional cat toys. Also loves sitting
                on keyboards and joining Zoom calls.</p>

            <p>Cooper is an 8yr old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy! He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He’s pretty friendly, but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p> 
            
            <p>Whenever it’s movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>
